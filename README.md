Alchemic Reality is a Mixed Reality alchemy game. In this game, the player manipulates physical cards representing ingredients and tools. By combining them, they can create magic potions with unknown effects, and try them on a test subject.

There are currently 10 cards in the game, but more could easily be added. These cards are split into three types : Ingredient, Action, and Special. Each is linked to a 3D model, which can change over time. Interactions between the different 3D models happen when they get close to one another in the real world.
